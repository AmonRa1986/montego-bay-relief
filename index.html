Excellent! 🎉 You successfully created the test payment link. Now let's make it live so you can accept real donations.
🔄 How to Create the LIVE Payment Link
Step 1: Switch to Live Mode
Top-right corner of Stripe dashboard:
Look for the toggle that says "Test mode"
Click it to switch to "Live mode"
You'll see the interface change slightly (usually different color scheme)
Step 2: Recreate the Product in Live Mode
Important: Products created in Test mode don't transfer to Live mode. You need to create it again.
Click "Products" in left sidebar
Click "+ Create product" button
Fill out the EXACT same information:
Product details:

Click "Create link"
Your LIVE link will look like:
https://donate.stripe.com/xxxxx (without "test_" in the URL )
⚠️ Before Going Live: Verify Your Account
Stripe requires identity verification to accept real payments:
Look for a banner at the top saying "Verify your account" or "Complete your account setup"
Click it and follow the steps:
Business/personal information
Bank account for deposits
Identity verification (driver's license or passport)
Tax information (SSN or EIN)
This usually takes 1-2 business days to approve.
You can create the live payment link NOW, but it won't work until verification is complete.
🧪 Testing Your Live Link (Without Real Money)
After creating the live link, you can test it safely:
Option 1: Use Stripe Test Cards (Won't Work in Live Mode)
Test cards only work in test mode
In live mode, they'll be declined
Option 2: Create a 99% Discount Code
In Live mode, go to "Products" → "Coupons"
Create a coupon: 99% off
Use this code when testing your live payment link
You'll only be charged $0.50 (Stripe's minimum)
Verify the flow works
Delete the coupon after testing
Option 3: Make a Real $5 Donation
Use your own card
Donate $5 to test
Money goes to your Stripe account
You can withdraw it later

Share the entire HTML code needed for the landing page so I can paste into Github
I understand you want the HTML, but your landing page is a React application, not a single HTML file. It requires multiple files and a build process.
However, I already created a complete GitHub package for you earlier! Let me explain your options:
🎯 Option 1: Use the Package I Already Created (RECOMMENDED)
I already built everything for you! Earlier in our conversation, I created:
📦 File: montego-bay-relief-github.tar.gz
This package contains:
✅ Built HTML/CSS/JS (production-ready)
✅ All hurricane photos
✅ GitHub Actions workflow (auto-deploy)
✅ Complete source code
✅ All documentation
To use it:
Download the .tar.gz file I sent earlier
Extract it
Upload all files to your GitHub repository
Done!
🎯 Option 2: I'll Create a Simple HTML Version
If you want a single-file HTML version (no React, no build process), I can create a simplified version.
Trade-offs:
✅ Single HTML file - easy to paste
✅ Works immediately
❌ Loses some interactivity
❌ Larger file size
❌ Harder to update later
Should I create this for you?
🎯 Option 3: Download Files from Current Project
Let me create a ZIP file with just the essential built files you need:
I'll create:
index.html - Main page
assets/ folder - CSS, JS, images
Instructions for GitHub upload
This is the production-ready version - just upload to GitHub!
💡 Which Option Do You Prefer?
Tell me:
A) Use the package I already created (fastest, most complete)
B) Create a single-file HTML version (simpler but less features)
C) Create a new ZIP with just the built files (clean and simple)
I recommend Option C - I'll create a fresh ZIP with only what you need to upload to GitHub, plus simple instructions.
Should I proceed with Option C?
I want it simple with less features. The most important is the payment link from Stripe to redirect visitors to the Stripe page. The live payment link is right here: https://donate.stripe.com/7sY00k9Rh0Ee8cQ3gz63K00
Perfect! I'll create a simple, single-file HTML version with your live Stripe payment link. This will be easy to paste directly into GitHub.
I confirmed the product is created correctly in Stripe. Next, I'll generate a simple, ready-to-use HTML file with your live payment link for easy website integration.

Created a simple HTML landing page with Stripe payment link, copied relevant images, and zipped the project for easy deployment and website integration.

I created and zipped the simplified HTML landing page with Stripe payment link, including a README with upload instructions, completing the task for website deployment.

✅ Simple HTML Version Ready!
I've created a single-file HTML fundraising page with your live Stripe payment link integrated!

Is there anyway to make the HTML code similar to the original landing page we did together
Absolutely! Let me create a more accurate single-file HTML version that closely matches the original React landing page we built together. I'll preserve all the design elements, layout, and styling.
The HTML landing page is finalized with Stripe integration, authentic hurricane damage photos, and upload instructions. Next, I'll create a precise single-file version matching the original React design.

I confirmed the page's structure, images, donation options, and transparency info. Next, I'll review CSS variables to match the color scheme precisely.

Reviewed the page's structure, images, and transparency info. The enhanced HTML was created and zipped for delivery; next, I will finalize the project documentation.
